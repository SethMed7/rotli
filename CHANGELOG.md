## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-24

First public release — a warm, local-first menu-bar notes app, now with a memex
brain and signed auto-updates.

### Added
- **memex integration** — rotli can read/connect/initiate a memex knowledge spine
  (for the maintainer, `~/smBrain`): a read-only Memory browser over `wiki`/`self`/
  `chats`, a Chat front that writes named `chats/` conversations, ⌥C captures that
  route to the brain's `inbox.md`, and "Browse in Notes" to make a memex the corpus.
  rotli owns `chats/` + `inbox.md` and never writes the brain's memory.
- **CodeMirror 6 editor** — inline WYSIWYG markdown (syntax hidden, revealed on the
  caret line), live preview, focus mode, and a fully rebindable keymap.
- **Signed in-app auto-update** — a quiet on-launch check + a manual "Check for
  updates / Install & relaunch" in Settings → General (no auto-download, no nags).
- The menu-bar shell — ⌥Space toggle, ⌥C one-breath capture, ⌥Q Quick Note, the
  Board, onboarding, and a local-file corpus (atomic writes, OS-trash deletes,
  external-edit watcher). Developer-ID signed + notarized.

### Release tooling
- `bun run build:mac`, `bun run release`, and the `bump-version` / `predmg-clean` /
  `make-latest-json` scripts.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- memex integration (Increments 1–3): detect/connect/init a memex instance,
  the read-only Memory browser over its spine, chats/ + inbox.md write seam, and
  "Browse in Notes" to point the Notes tree at a memex.
- Editor rewritten on CodeMirror 6: inline WYSIWYG markdown (syntax hidden,
  revealed on the caret line), live preview, focus mode, and the shared keymap.
- Onboarding flow, the Board surface, and the Quick Note window (⌥Q) with the
  ⌘P quick-note picker.
- The menu-bar shell: ⌥Space main toggle, ⌥C one-breath capture, the local-file
  corpus (atomic writes, OS-trash deletes, an external-edit watcher), and a
  fully rebindable hotkey engine.
